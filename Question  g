Yes, A method can be overloaded with the same return type. But there is a limitation
in overloaded the method with the same return type where the argument list should be differenct.  

Java is designed to have more methods in it. Method overloading is a technique used in java to have
more than one method in a program to perform multiple operations in a simplified manner without errors or complexity.


The method overloading concept can be explained with the example given below:

import java.util.*;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	Addition(133,002);				//method name
	
	Subtraction(234,134);			//method name
	}
	public static void Addition(int a,int b){
		System.out.println("Addition Number: "+(a+b));			//operation
		}
	
	public static void Subtraction(int a,int b){
		System.out.println("Subtraction Number: "+(a-b));			//operation
		}
	
	}

If we look at this example, we can find that the value entered is of the integer datatype and the 
return type is also of the same datatype.
